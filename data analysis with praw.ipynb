      "Comments : \n",
      "  ) There is no single way for the internships. Different types of internships demand different kinds of preparation.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  rst, if you have time, try fiddling around with different fields. It doesn’t matter how far or close it is to your major. But if it is very close to your major, it is an added bonus. Try to find and read up materials available on the topic. If possible, contact any professor who is working in that field and do some projects. Build up your profile and get experience.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  cond, maintain a resume. Update it regularly. Always keep your resume ready, to be submitted at the moment’s notice. Create a LinkedIn and/or SalaryShark account. (LinkedIn is more preferable.) Keep it updated, always.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Third, start early. If you are interested in research internships, then start searching and mailing the researchers in your field of interest. Search for fellowships which can even pay you in most cases. Some of the most prestigious fellowships are Indian Academy of Sciences, various fellowships provided by individual institutions.\n",
      "2 ) Most internships in financial services are atrociously advertised, even though they're (I'd speculate) the largest group of employers for interns and new graduates. I'm talking entire graduating classes being swallowed up at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at retail and investment banks, insurance companies, and your country's central bank for opportunities, usually around this time of year (you *may* be too late but I'd still try). Directly on their careers websites will be the place, or just google \"XYZ Ltd, data internship\"\n",
      "3 ) I got my internship position after searching for opportunities on the companie's webpage. I'm sure you have a list of companies that you would love to work at, don't you? Try to interact with them on their social media.\n"
