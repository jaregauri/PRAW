Searching on LinkedIn the lead is a university instructor. Makes me wonder if this was student project she advised and was unaware of the plagiarism.   In that case, I suppose I might start by reaching out to the lead author on  LinkedIn or via email and see how far that gets you. Next step would be to reach out to the university (dept head and dean).","Holy shit they aren't even trying to hide it.

You can report their work to ResearchGate to try to get it taken down ([https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy](https://www.researchgate.net/ip-policy)). You could also try contacting the university or one of the researchers. There's a chance this is one of the researcher's thesis/project and the other ""collaborators"" are just supervisors that don't know it's plagiarized.

The steps to the Scientific Method are:

1) Pose a Testable Question.  
2) Conduct Background Research.  
3) State your Hypothesis.  
4) Design Experiment.  
5) Perform your Experiment.  
6) Collect Data.  
7) Draw Conclusions.  
8) Publish Findings (optional).

You also are NOT trying to prove the hypothesis.  Let the facts speak for themselves and getting a clear example that invalidates a hypothesis is a powerful way to improve understanding."

Legend.,"This is an excellent resource for reviewing ML concepts, but I don't think calling it a DS cheatsheet is helping. There's already enough people thinking DS = ML.

A true DS cheatsheat would have sections on how to solve actual business problems, common KPIs, how to build and evaluate data/ML pipelines, etc. I know you said the purpose was to tackle things that are common to all DS positions, but IMO the things that are common (ML algorithms) generally make up a very small portion of any one job.

These are all resources focused upon putting ML into production and might help you out.","OP’s question should be upvoted because it’s very real for many data scientists that are hired by companies who “haven’t had anyone like this before.” 

If you’re truly going to a well known tech company then  you have plenty of opportunity to cross pollinate. This is untrue for many data pros who aren’t at large tech. 

I don’t have any specific advice other than the fact that you’re worried about it in the first place is the most important. Anyone who has that attitude and fear of mediocrity will find the path to betterment. Because just being okay is never going to be enough regardless of the team you’re on.","For production level code, you should be able to learn from other engineers at the company. Pay close attention to when they talk about topics like readability or how hard it'll be to maintain/operate the code over time. People transitioning from school usually over-value code that looks impressive or is clever, and undervalue making it easy to update the code, read the code, diagnose weird behaviors at all hours, deploy the code easily, etc. At a higher level, people starting out tend to overvalue the technical and undervalue interpersonal skills. Ask for feedback early and often.

Work on meeting a few people in similar roles in other companies - meetups can sometimes help for that."

This is from Benedict Evans' (of a16z) blog. I think the second paragraph is especially important in this context -  I can think of no better way of putting the point across.

* Reports are coming in PDFs from WHO and there are people out there trying to collate those into data sources that can be used as a data feed. 
* local areas especially are reporting data at a level that’s hard to be useful at a national level, but is very useful locally. 
* Building submission forms - most communicable disease reporting to states are still done via paper.
* Data presentation/visualization NOT forecasts or prediction

MODELING AND FORECASTING COVID-19 IS NOT USEFUL TO ANYONE. There are tons of people who are doing this who are way more qualified than any of us. Nobody is going to listen to you and you will not make any impact, they will be listening to experts.

 So, how can we help? Try and think what you can do for your community! Can you organize donations to restaurants to make curbside deliveries to senior citizens?

From this project, I learned quite a bit include Docker containerization, Git branching, Azure and Object oriented programming.

2020-12-28,821,It seems a lot of people want to get into the data science field without having the slightest idea of what it actually entails,"I understand people who want to change fields and become data scientists. Data science requires at minimum strong coding skills in SQL/Python/R, data visualizations, machine learning algorithms theory and implementation, and statistics. It is not something one picks up in a 2 week bootcamp. Come interview time, you would regret thinking that!

To get the job, two things matter most, the resume and interview. Resumes must list all the key data science skills, past work experience using data science, and value delivered. The interview can really cover anything. Resources for interview prep include [ML Interview Prep](https://www.aceainow.com), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com), blogs with sample questions like Analytics Vidhya and [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com).

For those who are just starting, there are more resources than ever before. I personally like An Introduction To Statistical Learning With Applications in R. There are plenty of online courses from Udacity/Coursera/Datacamp and others to get started with.","I'm one of those people that kind of stumbled into the field by chance. I have a degree in finance, but no formal education in CS. I started programming as a hobby during uni, and one of my professors by chance just hinted that I could look into data-science because it's a blooming field. I didn't really think about it too much at the time. Shortly after graduating though, I started investing more time into learning programming, then SQL, machine learning etc. I started doing some projects and as I got deeper into the field, I realized that I really enjoy the process, I like working with data and could see myself doing it for the long term. 

I do think it's a bit odd that there are people who don't seem to particularly like coding or working with datasets or mathematics, but want to get into the field. Maybe they like the idea of doing data-science (and believing it comes with a good paycheck?) more than they like the field.","Agreed! Having worked in data science- adjacent fields I can confirm that there are lots of self-professed data scientists with a vague understanding of the fundamentals.

2019-2-8,796,"3 years ago I discovered Data Science, this sub, and decided I wanted to become one. After two stepping stone jobs, a Masters Degree, endless advice from here, and tons of rejection (see image) I've finally done it!","Tools: http://sankeymatic.com/

Data: Self-gathered data on interview process, kept in a spreadsheet.

Time: 2 months of applying after completing my MS in Statistics in Dec of 2018

Location: NYC

Title: Data Scientist (Predictive Modeling)

Background: 3 years ago I discovered this sub, and dabbled in statistical modeling during my undergraduate degree (economics.) I greatly enjoyed taking data and making predictions out of it, and saw that I could do it for a living as something called a Data Scientist. After countless rejections with just a bachelors and my lame job that was analysis in Excel, I decided to enroll in graduate school and obtain my MS in Statistics to improve the statistical skills I had. I also moved to a job involving large databases and SQL, as I heard countless times that SQL is important in any data analysis role.

The hardest part was definitely breaking into the field, as most jobs required 1+ years of experience doing predictive modeling in past roles with R and Python. However, during school I spent a lot of time on my personal projects, and dedicated myself to becoming fluent in R and Python. I also worked really hard on my soft skills, such as communication and business acumen during my two jobs. My projects, these soft skills, and my machine learning knowledge had the best feedback during my interviews. Believe it or not, there is still a huge demand for the field (at least in NYC), as both jobs that I landed required 2-4 years of experience.

EDIT: You guys are awesome, thank you for the overwhelmingly positive response! My inbox is blowing up on people asking for advice - I will try to answer as much of them as I can. ","Taboo question (but it shouldn't be, especially since we're anonymous), what's the pay like for entry-level DS in NYC?","7/8 on coding challenges!! Good for you, congrats on the new job. "
2019-5-30,798,"Data Scientists spend up to 80% of time on ""data cleaning"" in preparation for data analysis, statistical modeling, & machine learning. Post Credit: Igor Korolev","IMO this is a large part of the reason data science/analytics aren't yet ready for self-service at the vast majority of companies. 

Data cleaning/prepping is a critical skill and a hard one to teach a computer since the rules for cleaning are found outside of existing lines of code. 

The day this hurdle is overcome is the day self-service becomes the norm.","I just started an internship in NYC as a data analyst for a data company that manages marine traffic imports and exports for oil and petroleum. Basically my entire job is going through their data tables and manually diagnosing problems such as typos, incorrect dates, wrong location, etc. This is an extremely tedious and repetitive task and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of how to automate some of these tasks using python. I know there are libraries such as pandas and numpy that help with automating data cleaning, but I’m not sure exactly how to do it. Btw they use Postgres for their database management.","Dumb question: what part of the process exactly is considered data cleaning? Is it a loose term or something specific that data scientists refer to.

There are parts of my workflow where I have to figure out a ""fix"" because of weird traits in the data (eg. I work on hyperspectral remote sensing and often times the spectral channels are different between different sources of data). Other times I just have to figure out more basic things like how the data is stored/formatted or identify some outliers/bad data that need to be removed. They all feel like ""data cleaning"" to me, but I've never been entirely sure it is what everyone else means."

questions like this.  These are the kind of thing I'd look up when trying to solve a specific problem but wouldn't know offhand.

2020-8-6,768,Scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates - The Verge,"Me: Excel, this is a string of numbers, don't apply any formatting.

Excel: No","So, to provide insight from someone who is doing bioinformatics for my PhD (since a lot of comments seem to think this is an issue for the bioinformatics/comp bio people themselves):

This is not a problem bioinformaticists *cause,* per se, or something that really affects our work *if we are given access original raw files*. Standard tools in bioinformatics include R, Python, etc. No one directly involved in the field uses Excel for any ""serious"" analysis. We can all program to some extent.

What *does* happen, however, it that we have to pass data on to wet lab biologists - i.e., the people who actually perform experiments. This group of people generally cannot program at all or have a very, very limited understanding of how to run (not *write*) scripts that are written for them. They also generally do not understand the concept of file formats beyond Word vs. PDF vs. Excel, etc. The idea of csv, tsv, etc. is not something they are familiar with.

The ends up causing the following chain of events:

1) Bioinformaticist run RNAseq analysis, ultimately generating a table of gene counts with samples as columns and genes as rows. This is saved in a txt or csv file. Associated plots are generated to display results (heatmaps, volcano plots, etc.), and the final output table with adjusted p values, fold-changes, etc. from differential analysis is produced and saved as a txt or csv.

2) Wet lab biologist wants the raw counts table in addition to the figures and final output table. This is absolutely fine in concept. They should have the raw table too!

3) Bioinformaticist shares (via email or a cloud storage system or what have you) the files as the original txt or csv.

4) Wet lab biologist wants to make this easier for them to see. Keep in mind, they cannot (by and large) use R or Python, so they use Excel. They then save a copy for themselves as an Excel workbook, so they can sort, conditional format, etc. This results in several gene names getting converted to dates; however, given the human genome is 18-20,000 genes, and some of the oddly named genes are not super popular to study, this goes entirely unnoticed by the wet lab biologist (who may or may not even know this is an issue).

In the end, the chance of this issue getting addressed by the wet lab biologist is slim to none - this has been a documented issue since microarrays were standard technology. So, in order to prevent it from even occurring to begin with, the computational people have taken it upon themselves to fix by just changing gene names/annotations.",This is funny because gene and protein nomenclature is sooo inconsistent across different databases. Having excel read genes as dates is literally a drop in that the ocean of redundancies across genomic databases.
2020-3-23,760,Beginner project for SQL. This is a simple python script to scrape stock prices off NASDAQ API and feed it to MySQL.,"This is such a nice beginner project. Good job.

Some suggestions for improvement:

Don't commit after each SQL line to make it more efficient. (Just add a semicolon on line 54, switch = to +=. Finally, move all the lines that follow  one tab to the left. 

Also close your DB at the end. Line 64 one tab to the left.

Some suggestions of things you can add to make it simpler to use:

\- Allow multiple symbol entries at once. Hint: use split function which puts the symbols into an array.

\- Read symbols from a file: This way you have a config file you can easily adjust without touching your code. In half a year you won't know everything that happens here so it's easier for yourself.

&#x200B;

There's some more things I'd change but as this is a beginner exercise it's good enough for now.","Very nice! I would recommend the following steps if you're looking to improve your code :

1. Abstract your API calls and dB statements into functions - put in arguments in there to see how that part functions.

2. Try looking into how you can run this on a schedule / on a trigger of some sort.

3. Look into the Pandas library to look at some kind of rudimentary analysis you can do on your data.

All of which is to say, this profession involves a lot of initiative, salesmanship, and ""eating what you kill"", which can be compelling or horrible depending on the person.  More than anything, this is why DS is not the best job for people with no work experience."
2021-1-14,673,"We Need More Data Engineers, Not Data Scientists","There is a rather clear shift in the market indeed which can be explained by different factors:

* Data leaders are more educated and now know better what it takes to run a successful data team as they generally have witnessed it or done it in a couple of companies before.
* Those companies realize that the basis of a good DS work is to have the data neatly acquired, processed, modelled, organized and accessible. Doing this right makes the reporting, science and all other downstream parts much easier.
* They also realize that this is a specific skillset and it should not fall on the shoulder of a data scientist but of a dedicated data engineer.
* In parallel, the Data Scientist role starts to be divided into more precise sub roles, some more oriented towards business (business analyst, product analyst, data analyst, BI developer,...) some more towards engineering (ML Engineer, ML Ops, ML Scientist,...). So there are less purely ""Data Scientist"" roles but a bunch of new specialized roles which bring more clarity towards what's actually expected from the professionals.
* Another trend is the greater need for automation and therefore engineering. During years companies/DSs have developed methods to solve some specific problems and some of these tools are becoming standard and can be mostly/fully automated. Therefore, there is a need for more engineering-focused role to do this correctly.

EDIT: Forgot to add: volume of data is also getting bigger with time, so that also generates a higher need for people who actually know how to deal with such volumes.","We also need data scientists that focus on stats ... or .. and this is going to be mind boggling ... we need actual statisticians .

I think the ideal data science team should pair highly experienced and trained statisticians with their counterpart CS/data engineer to solve a DS problem.",Software engineer here that has been doing data engineering for the past years. For some reason software engineering seems to still pay more than data engineering roles. Also not having to deal with matching table records or semi-manual etl jobs is another plus. I wonder if data engineer salaries will raise in the next years.
2021-7-20,679,"FYI: If You're New to the Industry, the Data Science Job Market is Saturated","In my opinion, it is much safer to develop expertise in a domain (healthcare, insurance, banking etc.) and then apply data science principles to your domain. That's what I have done. I am not a data scientist and nobody will hire me for my data science ""skills"" (honestly I am not skilled like many people in this sub). Instead I have been able to cement my reputation (and get good raises) as I brought data driven insights and speed to decision making in my job. This may not be possible for everyone but developing domain expertise and then applying data science is easier that chasing a few pure play data science positions.",And many of them aren’t worth hiring.,"The industry is the wild west. Everyone sees the common themes: no one knows what data scientist means, misaligned expectations, non existent workflows and pipelines, companies having no strategy when hiring a data scientist, frankly inability to identify strengths, etc, etc. It's going to be like this for a while. Best way in as I see it, get some sme knowledge and learn the data science pieces. Take focused course work with this edge. Building models is foundational, and yet probably less than 10% of the battle."
2021-7-10,674,Low key the new icon kinda sucks,"Hey, thanks for the discussion thread! I am the mod who has been updating it and created a sticky last week for a place to make suggestions and didn’t get much feedback. 

The original icon was testing, but had complaints it was hard to see, which was understandable and it turned out to be not in free domain. So I had to make a quick change and I figured floppy disk was storage related and nostalgic for some. 

After looking through a ton of icons there is not really any icons that really represent data science as a whole as the field is so diverse. Data storage ended up seeming like the best fit. It is obvious in this thread that the theme just isn’t working, so I will disable it here shortly!",The floppy disk? Is that the logo?

2021-3-17,660,Imposter syndrome and prioritizing what to learn,"Great post!

I would add that, particularly on LinkedIn, there is an ""instagram"" effect where people are broadcasting their achievements but people rarely call out the challenges or where they fail.","This resonates strongly with me. Thank you for sharing your experiences in such a well-thought-out post!  Something I struggle with in data science is there are SO MANY THINGS to learn and it’s very difficult to decide what to prioritize.  I end up working myself to death. 

For instance, I’m looking for a new job. What I want is to work on a small team of people with diverse educational backgrounds, struggle through problems, and make good things happen. I know I can teach myself anything. That’s basically what all my years of school were for; not an end goal of “knowledge,” but rather a framework for being able to learn and do anything in DS.  But others don’t think this way (see: all job descriptions in DS).  What if the perfect job passes me by because something they need isn’t on my resume?  What if it passes me by because I don’t have a PhD?  Both have happened. It only increases my feeling of incompetence. 

So, my problem is I don’t KNOW what to prioritize because a) there is just so much to learn and frankly almost all of it is interesting, and b) my career goals are oriented more around working on hard problems and solving them, and less on what the specific problems are.",Also- ask your boss. My company is big on angular so I planned to learn it in my free time. But boss lady said she really needed an API product owner for an api we are taking over from from another Dept... so now I am getting better with API’s and focusing on that
2020-8-4,653,I am tired of being assessed as a 'software engineer' in job interviews.,"I'm of two minds on this.

Sure, it's unlikely that leetcode will be terribly helpful for most DS jobs, the same way it's not immediately useful for most dev jobs.

But the industry is starting to favor data scientists that have legit SWE chops (at least for the most in-demand jobs and companies).  This is just the way it's going right now as companies try to emulate the big tech shops and incorporate ML into production.  That is primarily an engineering task.  They aren't wrong for demanding competent engineering.

That said, I typically decline timed online code tests, especially if they're given before I even talk to anyone. At least if it's a whiteboard or a paired coderpad, they're investing their time into it as well.","> Don't expect me to write some janky-ass tree-based sorting algorithm from scratch when it has 0% relevance to what my actual job involves

It doesn't have a whole lot to do with what a software engineer does either, but we haven't really figured out a better way to semi-reliably test coding ability other than these stupid exercises.","I agree interviewers get caught up on algorithms problems when not appropriate for job. That said, I also expect the data scientists to be among the best problem solvers. For my company, the ability to work with graph data is critical. I'm less concerned with implementation quality for problems than how they think about problem (so I prefer live/zoom interview over web-based coding exercise). As an example, we made an offer to a candidate that didn't recognize a DFS graph problem but was able to ask good questions and come up with an equivalent solution with minor code bugs. The thinking was we could trust someone like that to be independent, which is very valuable for a team of our size (<20).

Anyway, I think there are interviewers that ask questions like that for good and bad reasons."

2020-11-7,655,First Year As A Data Scientist Reflection,"Solid advice from what I can tell is a true data scientist. It still is a vast, vague, less-understood field despite the hype around it. I like what you said about stakeholders not even knowing what they truly want. It's the data scientist's job to help visualize the goal for them, too. This is the ""art"" in data science that so many overlook (and therefore struggle with).

Reminds me of the classic example of customers wanting as high as an accuracy as possible in a binary classification, while not understanding the impact of false negatives in a critical situation.","I am 18 months into a role as a DataOps engineer, working with big companies' data teams to implement projects, and I would 100% agree!

'Slowing down' a project upfront to ensure everyone actually knows what is needed, what the outputs will be and what assumptions need to be made is incredibly important. Whilst these are decisions that can be guided by the DS, the business experts should be brought into it along the way, which helps to 1) ensure you're not making bad assumptions and 2) avoid the DS basically working in waterfall mode and presenting a 'finished' project 2 months later with no feedback.","I am 5 years in the job right now and I can say that you have learnt a lot in the first year.
 
I just want to add one thing that I learnt. If you have issues acessing data, that needs to become your number 1 priority. Your work will be slow and meaningless and painful until you have a proper data storage dedicated to research, where you can play without risking to impact the production environment."

2021-2-27,642,R is far superior to Python for data manipulation.,"As someone who spends a lot of time using both R and Python about 50/50, here's how it plays out in reality:

- R is better for: tabular data manipulation, data viz, simple models (e.g. OLS).

- Python is better for: *Everything else*, including nontabular data manipulation, neural networks/AI, and most importantly deployment.

*You can do all tasks in both languages*, but usually it comes at the cost of unexpected technical debt if you don't use the right tool for the right job.","Without arguing with your points I just want to say that in pandas you can also chain operations to create variables, manipulate them, and so on. For example:

    (df.assign(c = df['a'] + 2)
     .query('c>3')
     .dropna())

&#x200B;

It surprises me, that people often forget about it.

As for me, I tried using R without Tidyverse of dplyr and didn't like it. I admit that I have heard a lot of good things about them, but in my latest projects working with data frames is only a small part of all the process, so I don't have reasons to do anything in R.","Sounds you’re just talking about structured data.

2020-5-7,636,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,"Awesome write-up, I’m not a hiring manager but I totally agree on this. Don’t just work on a project to build your portfolio, but find a problem that’s actually interesting to you. 

Along with the numerous benefits OP posted above in regard to overcoming challenges (particularly the messiness of data), I personally think passion about a project makes it a lot more valuable when explaining it to an interviewer (and also it’s more fun for you to work on!).","I don't always see eye to eye with things that /u/dfphd posts, but, as a hiring manager as well, this is pretty spot on.

> If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

So. Many. Kaggle. Examples. 

Seriously, its almost an instant 'nope' if I see another kaggle housing data set personal project. I've even had a few people show me problems on the iris data set. 

Solve something real and unique, that YOU find interesting, and not just for the sake of solving it, do it because you're passionate about learning and exploration, and because you see an actual gap that can be filled.

Quality post.","Totally agree. Being a data scientist is as much about creative problem solving and critical thinking as it is about technical skills. Show the hiring manager that you can pull a question out of the abstract, and then make an interesting explanation for it using your skills. Pick a topic that makes people think, “huh, that’s cool!” The publication “The Pudding” is a good source for ideas like this."
