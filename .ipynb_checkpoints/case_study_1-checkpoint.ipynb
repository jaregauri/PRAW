    "\n",
    "Assume you are new to the data science field, and you want to find out what real practitioners and wannabe data scientists are concerned about. One place where you may find such information is Twitter. However, Twitter users often use their real identities and may have reservations about sharing all their opinions publicly. Another place where such information maybe found is the datascience subreddit on Reddit.com (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Users are assumed to be anonymous and they are more likely to share their opinions without reservations. To find out common concerns among the datascience subreddit users, it might be a good idea to collect the top 100 posts in the subreddit in the year 2021. You might also collect the top 3 comments of each of those posts. In this case study, we will do exactly that. Specific details can be found in the next few cells. \n",

    "Once you have the mechanism in place to retrieve data from Reddit, you next step is to determine which parts of the data is necessary. For this case study, collect only the top posts from the year 2021. Also consider if the score of each post was above 50 or not. If the score was below 50, it might not have been an important post. Do not consider those posts. \n",

I already took calc 2 and I think I could squeeze in a couple of math classes (prob theory and Calc 3) to supplement the degree.\n",
      "3 ) Hi! I've heard countless times that it's better to pursue CS as an undergrad and then DS if one is interested in the latter, since it opens better opportunities and makes them more 'marketable'. This however isn't an option for me. I'm currently enrolled in a bachelor's programme in data science and programming, would it be possible and viable for me to enrol in a master's programme in CS after completing it? If so, how much of a knowledge gap am I looking at to cover so that I wouldn't lack behind the CS majors with whom I'd be doing the masters?\n",

      "Title :  Any Data Scientists here working for Microsoft or Amazon?\n",
      "Comments : \n",
      "1 ) I joined Amazon as a Data Scientist a few months ago in NYC.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What kinds of projects are you working on as a data scientist?** Have you ever seen a product on Amazon that has only one photo, no text, and looks \"fake\"? Our team is working to help sellers improve their product listings. Our team builds models that are trained on and score the entire Amazon catalogue. We serve recommendations to sellers, e.g. \"add 4+ photos\". I'm currently building tracking to measure the impact of our product and concurrently performing causal inference studies on existing integrations.\n",
      "2. **How have you grown as a data scientist since joining your company?** I barely knew AWS services before I joined, and I've been learning these services left and right since then. I enjoy the software and data engineering aspect of DS. One perk of working for Amazon is that you get all the AWS access you need.\n",
      "3. **How does your company measure success of your projects?** No idea, but I don't think there's a simple answer. Generally speaking, it seems like you need to validate your own results and present them to a room of other scientists in what resembles peer review.\n",
      "4. **How much corporate red tape do you have to deal with?** Almost zero. It's actually quite remarkable. Amazon is notorious for moving fast and not requiring signoff or permission for most things. They actively promote \"bias for action\" within the company. As far as I can tell, it is part of the culture.\n",
      "5. **How much autonomy do you have? (For example to pursue a hunch where there is a potential for improvement even if no one notices or cares)** Lots. I'm treated far more senior than I was at my previous company. I report to one person and that's my manager. He listens to me on science topics and generally gives me ample control over what I am doing.\n",
      "6. **What would you change about your company?** Amazon has some legacy internal tooling (outside AWS) that can be quite painful to work with. I also wish it was easier to use open source. It's certainly possible, but not always as easy as it should be.\n",
      "7. **What's the remote work policy?** Atm, we are full remote. Starting in January, official policy from the top down is 3 days in, 2 days remote, although that might change.\n",
      "8. **How's your work life balance?** So far great, but I'm still new. I think the long term answer is good not great. It's better than a startup, but there are big scary deadlines that you need to meet. FYI being a DS is quite a bit better than being a Data Engineer, because you won't be on call.\n",
      "2 ) have you considered doing data science for DoD or IC at Amazon? They generally are looking for DS with clearances. I am not a DS but work for AWS and familiar with those internal orgs. Happy to chat if you have more questions.\n",
      "3 ) Another decent place to ask these kind of questions would be on BLIND.\n",
      "---------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Title :  Am I not doing things right or is this part of the job?\n",
      "Comments : \n",
      "1 ) Give yourself some grace. You’re new to a tough career. \n",
      "\n",
      "They said, you need to address the root issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why aren’t your stakeholders satisfied? In your estimation what are others doing that you aren’t able to replicate?\n",
      "2 ) For the record I think other posters bring up valid points. I would add that much of the time, even the stakeholders themselves may struggle to determine their own needs in terms of what kind of outputs would be useful. Maybe at this point, consider talking to your manager about your concerns, and see if there's a way to strip away some of the complexity to launch an MVP (minimum viable product) that would satisfy some portion of the stakeholders' immediate needs. It's tempting to take a problem and try to tackle it all at once, but if you can quickly turn around a model (or heck, even just set up a rules-based model based on SQL case statements) to handle a good chunk of it, you can start that feedback loop to guide future iterations of the project.\n",
      "3 ) You've got to manage people's expectations. My first week I got asked to build a machine learning model to make up for 90% of the data missing. I said no, that's a data engineering problem, just fix the source system pipelines. If they still push, tell them you'd like a million dollars since we're dreaming.\n"
